In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), there is, in common with many other
age-related diseases, the need to distinguish between changes in the ageing eye
that lead to disease and those changes that are considered part of a healthy,
ageing eye. Various studies investigating the multitude of mechanisms involved in
the aetiology of AMD exist within the field of ophthalmology and related medical 
fields, yet many aspects of it remain poorly understood and only a limited number
of therapies are available. A recent study relates drusen's topographically
cellular characteristics to the neural retina's metabolic needs and associated
cholesterol involvement within the retina. In particular, there is a need to
fully understand the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis in the retina to
prevent normal ageing processes from being perturbed towards maculopathy. Here,
we present an extensive review of the clinical and physiological features of the 
ageing retina, as well as mechanisms implicated in pathology, synthesised from a 
vast body of the published literature. We use this novel synthesis to construct a
comprehensive process schematic, encompassing all key species and physiological
processes such as nutrients, waste and lipoprotein management. We are therefore
able to express these processes in a mathematical language via a comprehensive
modelling framework, comprising a set of twenty-three equations spanning three
distinct biological compartments. This very general modelling framework may now
be adapted to more focused studies on individual mechanisms, processes or
components underlying of the many facets of AMD. As an example of such a focused 
application, we conclude this article with a one-compartment, four-species model 
of the retinal pigment epithelium, which considers the parametric conditions
under which either cholesterol homeostasis or unregulated accumulation of
cholesterol may obtain in the ageing eye.

BACKGROUND: The Quick Exposure Check (QEC) is an instrument to identify
occupational risk factors, and to screen subjects for the risk of musculoskeletal
disorders in their workplace.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective observational study was the
cross-cultural adaptation of the QEC for Persian (QEC-Pr) speaking workers and
the determination of the minimally required psychometric properties, including
reliability and validity, in a Persian population.
METHODS: The forward-backward translation was completed according to the
published guidelines. A total of 217 male construction workers were recruited.
The Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) tool was used as the criterion. The Inter-
and intra-rater reliability was performed respectively in a sub-sample of n<U+200A>=<U+200A>50 
and n<U+200A>=<U+200A>30. Convergent validity was determined from the correlation between the
QEC-Pr and the RULA. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's ¥á.
RESULTS: High levels of inter-rater reliability (ICC2.1 range<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.79-0.93),
intra-rater reliability (ICC2.1 range<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.74-0.89) and internal consistency
(¥á=<U+200A>0.74) were obtained. Concurrent validity between the different sections of
the QEC and RULA scores were determined to be fair but below the desired level
(range r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.41-0.44).
CONCLUSIONS: The QEC-Pr can be applied as a specific risk assessment instrument
for different occupational situations, such as the construction industry, in
Persian language populations.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is underrecognized, undertreated, and
understudied: each of these endeavors requires efficient and accurate
identification of patients with PAD. Currently, PAD patient identification relies
on diagnosis/procedure codes or lists of patients diagnosed or treated by
specific providers in specific locations and ways. The goal of this research was 
to leverage natural language processing to more accurately identify patients with
PAD in an electronic health record system compared with a structured data-based
approach.
METHODS: The clinical notes from a cohort of 6861 patients in our health system
whose PAD status had previously been adjudicated were used to train, test, and
validate a natural language processing model using 10-fold cross-validation. The 
performance of this model was described using the area under the receiver
operating characteristic and average precision curves; its performance was
quantitatively compared with an administrative data-based least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach using the DeLong test.
RESULTS: The median (SD) of the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve for the natural language processing model was 0.888 (0.009) versus 0.801
(0.017) for the LASSO-based approach alone (DeLong P<0.0001). The median (SD) of 
the area under the precision curve was 0.909 (0.008) versus 0.816 (0.012) for the
structured data-based approach. When sensitivity was set at 90%, the precision
for LASSO was 65% and the machine learning approach was 74%, while the
specificity for LASSO was 41% and for the machine learning approach was 62%.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a natural language processing approach in addition to partial 
cohort preprocessing with a LASSO-based model, we were able to meaningfully
improve our ability to identify patients with PAD compared with an approach using
structured data alone. This model has potential applications to both
interventions targeted at improving patient care as well as efficient,
large-scale PAD research.

Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field, combining
linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to enable machines to 
read and understand human language for meaningful purposes. Recent advancements
in deep learning have begun to offer significant improvements in NLP task
performance. These techniques have the potential to create new automated tools
that could improve clinical workflows and unlock unstructured textual information
contained in radiology and clinical reports for the development of radiology and 
clinical artificial intelligence applications. These applications will combine
the appropriate application of classic linguistic and NLP preprocessing
techniques, modern NLP techniques, and modern deep learning techniques.

PURPOSE: The CarerQol instrument has been designed and validated as an instrument
able to measure both the positive and the negative impacts of caregiving on the
quality of life of informal caregivers (CarerQol-7D), as well as their general
happiness (CarerQol-VAS). The aim of this study was to assess the construct
validity of the CarerQol in the Hungarian context.
METHODS: The CarerQol was translated into Hungarian. Subsequently, in a
cross-sectional online survey, representative for the general Hungarian
population (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000), informal caregivers were identified (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>149, female
51.2%, mean age 53.2). Clinical, convergent and discriminant validity of the
CarerQol were evaluated in relation to the caregivers' and care recipients'
EQ-5D-5L health status, and caregiving situation characteristics.
RESULTS: Average CarerQol-7D and CarerQol-VAS scores were 76.0 (SD 16.2) and 6.8 
(SD 2.3), respectively. CarerQol-7D and CarerQol-VAS scores were significantly
correlated with caregiving time (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.257; -<U+2009>0.212), caregivers' EQ-5D-5L
scores (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.453; 0.326) and the CarerQol-7D also with care recipients' EQ-5D-5L
scores (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.247). CarerQol-7D scores differed significantly with relevant
caregiving characteristics (e.g. nature and severity of care recipients' health
status, sharing household) and both the CarerQol-7D and CarerQol-VAS with the
overall care experience.
CONCLUSION: Our findings confirmed the validity of the Hungarian language version
of the CarerQol and support the cross-cultural validity of the instrument.
CarerQol-7D scores performed better in distinguishing caregiving situation
characteristics than the general happiness measure CarerQol-VAS. Care recipients'
health status was only weakly associated with informal caregivers' care-related
quality of life and happiness. Caregivers' own health and caregiving
circumstances were more strongly associated with these scores.

Objective: To investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS) on cognitive function of delayed encephalopathy after carbon monoxide
poisoning (DEACMP) . Methods: A total of 58 patients with DEACMP admitted to the 
Emergency Medicine Department of Hudson International Peace Hospital from January
2018 to January 2020 were included. According to the random number table, the
patients were randomly divided into study group and control group, with 29
patients in each group. Patients in both groups were given nutritional nerve
therapy, improved microcirculation, adrenal cortical hormone and other drugs, as 
well as hyperbaric oxygen and rehabilitation training, once per day. The study
group was treated with tDCS (electrode pads were placed and current stimulation
was given 30 min/time) 1/d on the basis of conventional treatment, while the
control group was treated with tDCS pseudo stimulation (electrode pads were
placed and current stimulation was given for 10 s) 1/d for 30 days consecutively.
The auditory event-related potential P300 (ERP-P300) was tested before and 30
days after treatment, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, Barthel
index (BI) and the National Institutes of Health Neurological Impairment score
(NIHSS) were used to evaluate and analyze the patients. Results: There was no
significant difference in scores between the two groups before treatment (all
P>0.05) . After 30 days of treatment, the MMSE score, orientation, memory,
attention and computing power, and language ability of the study group were all
higher than those of the control group, and the differences were statistically
significant (P<0.05) . 90 days after treatment, the BI of the study group was
higher than that of the control group (P<0.05) . After 30 days of treatment, the 
NIHSS score of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control
group (P<0.05) . The latency of ERP-P300 in the study group was shorter than that
in the control group, and the amplitude was higher than that in the control group
at 30 days after treatment, and the difference was statistically significant
(P<0.05) . The latency of ERP-P300 was negatively correlated with the total MMSE 
score before and after DEACMP treatment (r=-0.837, -0.819, P<0.05) . The latency 
of ERP-P300 was negatively correlated with orientation, attention and computing
power, and language ability before treatment (r=-0.698, -0.675, -0.742, P<0.05) .
Conclusion: TDCS treatment can help improve the cognitive function of DEACMP
patients, and ERP-P300 test can help determine the cognitive function severity of
patients.

Olfactory receptor (OR) genes in humans form a special class characterized by
unusually high DNA sequence diversity, which should give rise to differences in
perception and behavior. In the largest genome-wide association study to date
based on olfactory testing, we investigated odor perception and naming with smell
tasks performed by 9,122 Icelanders, with replication in a separate sample of
2,204 individuals. We discovered an association between a low-frequency missense 
variant in TAAR5 and reduced intensity rating of fish odor containing
trimethylamine (p.Ser95Pro, pcombined<U+00A0>= 5.6<U+00A0>¡¿ 10-15). We demonstrate that TAAR5
genotype affects aversion to fish odor, reflected by linguistic descriptions of
the odor and pleasantness ratings. We also discovered common sequence variants in
two canonical olfactory receptor loci that associate with increased intensity and
naming of licorice odor (trans-anethole: lead variant p.Lys233Asn in OR6C70,
pcombined<U+00A0>= 8.8<U+00A0>¡¿ 10-16 and pcombined<U+00A0>= 1.4<U+00A0>¡¿ 10-9) and enhanced naming of
cinnamon (trans-cinnamaldehyde; intergenic variant rs317787-T, pcombined<U+00A0>= 5.0<U+00A0>¡¿ 
10-17). Together, our results show that TAAR5 genotype variation influences human
odor responses and highlight that sequence diversity in canonical OR genes can
lead to enhanced olfactory ability, in contrast to the view that greater
tolerance for mutations in the human OR repertoire leads to diminished function.

BACKGROUND: There are investigations of multiple photosensitizers for modulation 
of caries-related biofilms using PDT. However, much controversy remains about
recommended parameters mostly on the selection of an efficient photosensitizer.
OBJECTIVE: The study performed a systematic review to identify the answer to the 
following question: What photosensitizers can present high bactericidal efficacy 
against cariogenic biofilms?
METHODS: Systematic review with meta-analyses were carried out for English
language articles from October to December 2019 (PRISMA standards) using MEDLINE,
Scopus, Biomed Central, EMBASE, LILACS, and Web of Science. Information on study 
design, biofilm model, photosensitizer, light source, energy delivery, the
incubation time for photosensitizer, and bacterial reduction outcomes were
recorded. We performed two meta-analyses to compare bacterial reduction, data was
expressed by (1) base 10 Logarithm values and (2) Log reduction RESULTS: After
the eligibility criteria were applied (PEDro scale), the selected studies showed 
that toluidine Blue Ortho (TBO) and methylene blue (MBO) (5-min incubation time
and 5-min irradiation) demonstrated better bacterial reduction outcomes. For the 
data expressed by Log TBO, MBO, curcumin, and Photogem¢ç presented a significant
bacterial decrease in comparison to the control (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.042). For the data
represented by Log reduction, the bacterial reduction toward S.mutans was not
significant for any photosensitizer (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.679).
CONCLUSION: While the lack of methodological standardization among the studies
still hinders the establishment of type of photosensitizer and bactericidal
efficiency, studies employing TBO, MBO, curcumin, and photogem indicate greater
PDT-based bacterial reduction on caries-related bacteria.. Further clinical
studies are necessary in order to obtain conclusive results.

Objective: This study is aimed at using genes related to the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway to establish a prognostic risk
model in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC).
Methods: For this study, we first found the PPAR pathway-related genes on the
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) website and found the KIRC mRNA expression
data and clinical data through TCGA database. Subsequently, we used R language
and multiple R language expansion packages to analyze the expression, hazard
ratio analysis, and coexpression analysis of PPAR pathway-related genes in KIRC. 
Afterward, using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins 
(STRING) website, we established the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of
genes related to the PPAR pathway. After that, we used LASSO regression curve
analysis to establish a prognostic survival model in KIRC. Finally, based on the 
model, we conducted correlation analysis of the clinicopathological
characteristics, univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis.
Results: We found that most of the genes related to the PPAR pathway had
different degrees of expression differences in KIRC. Among them, the high
expression of 27 genes is related to low survival rate of KIRC patients, and the 
high expression of 13 other genes is related to their high survival rate. Most
importantly, we used 13 of these genes successfully to establish a risk model
that could accurately predict patients' prognosis. There is a clear correlation
between this model and metastasis, tumor, stage, grade, and fustat.
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the
entire PPAR pathway in KIRC in detail and successfully establish a risk model for
patient prognosis. We believe that our research can provide valuable data for
future researchers and clinicians.

INTRODUCTION: The molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still not
clear, and the relationship between gene expression profile for different brain
regions has not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: Bioinformatic analysis at the genetic level has become the best way
for the pathogenesis research of AD, which can analyze the abovementioned
relationship.
METHODS: In this study, the datasets of AD were obtained from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO), and Qlucore Omics Explorer (QOE) software was used to screen
differentially expressed genes of GSE36980 and GSE9770 and verify gene expression
of GSE63060. The Gene Ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis of these
selected genes was conducted by Database for Annotation, Visualization, and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID), and then the gene/protein interaction network was
established by STRING to find the related proteins. R language was used for
drafting maps and plots.
RESULTS: There were 20 differentially expressed genes related to AD selected from
GSE36980 (p = 6.2e-6, q = 2.9422e-4) and GSE9770 (p = 3.3e-4, q = 0.016606).
Their expression levels of the AD group were lower than those in the control
group and varied among different brain regions. Cellular morphogenesis and
establishment or maintenance of cell polarity were enriched, and LRRTM1 and
RASAL1 were identified by the integration network. Moreover, the analysis of
GSE63060 verified the expression level of LRRTM1 and RASAL1 in Alzheimer's
patients, which was much lower than that in normal people aged >65 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of AD at molecular levels may link to cell membrane
structures and signal transduction; hence, a list of 20 genes, including LRRTM1
and RASAL1,potentially are important for the discovery of treatment target or
molecular marker of AD.

OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratio and the budget impact of
sending text messages associated with medical consultations in order to reduce
the viral load of patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
METHOD: a randomized clinical trial, basis for the development of a dynamic
cohort model with Markov states in order to compare medical appointments for
adults infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus versus the alternative
strategy that associated medical consultations to sending text messages through
telephone.
RESULTS: 156 adults participated in the study. As for the viral load, it was
verified that in the control group there was an increase, in the intervention
group A (weekly messages) there was a reduction (p = 0.002) and in group B
(biweekly messages) there was no statistically significant difference. Sending
text messages would prevent 286,538 new infections by the Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus and 282 deaths in the 20-year period, compared to the standard treatment.
The alternative strategy would result in saving R$ 14 billion in treatment costs.
CONCLUSION: weekly sending messages in association with the standard treatment
can reduce the circulating viral load due to its effect in decreasing new
infections, in addition to reducing health costs.

Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States.

BACKGROUND: Despite the results of the Testosterone Trials, physicians remain
uncomfortable treating men with hypogonadism. Discouraged, men increasingly turn 
to social media to discuss medical concerns.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to apply natural language processing
(NLP) techniques to social media posts for identification of themes of discussion
regarding low testosterone and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in order to
inform how physicians may better evaluate and counsel patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively extracted posts from the Reddit community
r/Testosterone from December 2015 through May 2019. We applied an NLP technique
called the meaning extraction method with principal component analysis (MEM/PCA) 
to computationally derive discussion themes. We then performed a prospective
analysis of Twitter data (tweets) that contained the terms low testosterone, low 
T, and testosterone replacement from June through September 2019.
RESULTS: A total of 199,335 Reddit posts and 6659 tweets were analyzed. MEM/PCA
revealed dominant themes of discussion: symptoms of hypogonadism, seeing a
doctor, results of laboratory tests, derogatory comments and insults, TRT
medications, and cardiovascular risk. More than 25% of Reddit posts contained the
term doctor, and more than 5% urologist.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first NLP evaluation of the social media
landscape surrounding hypogonadism and TRT. Although physicians traditionally
limit their practices to within their clinic walls, the ubiquity of social media 
demands that physicians understand what patients discuss online. Physicians may
do well to bring up online discussions during clinic consultations for low
testosterone to pull back the curtain and dispel myths.

OBJECTIVES: To validate and assess the reliability of the new version of an
Arabic speech intelligibility rating among di erent raters.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis was carried out between December 2018 and 
January 2019. Thirty cochlear-implant (CI) children (study group) and 30 subjects
(control group) were enrolled. Study candidates' speech skills were evaluated
using the translated Arabic SIR by parents and original SIR by professions such
as speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Inter-rater agreement, test-retest
reliability, pre- and post-intervention score (responsiveness test), patient
versus control score comparison (discriminant validity), and cross-validation of 
Arabic SIR have all been assessed.
RESULTS: There was a good sense of agreement between the post-operative SIR
parents' assessments and the professional SLPs' assessments (r=0.920, p less
than<U+00A0>0.001). The mean of study subjects pre- and post-implantation score of
Arabic SIR showed a statistically significant difference (p less than<U+00A0>0.001).
CONCLUSION: The Arabic SIR demonstrated excellent reliability with strong
consistency. It showed its clinical ability in distinguishing healthy subjects
from patients along with follow up of speech development skills over time. The
Arabic SIR can be used by parents to evaluate post-CI progress of their children.

Center, New Orleans, Louisiana

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Usher syndrome type I (USH1) is characterized by
congenital, bilateral, profound sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular areflexia,
and adolescent-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Unless fitted with a cochlear
implant, individuals do not typically develop speech. RP, a progressive,
bilateral, symmetric degeneration of rod and cone functions of the retina,
develops in adolescence, resulting in progressively constricted visual fields and
impaired visual acuity.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of USH1 is established in a proband using
electrophysiologic and subjective tests of hearing and retinal function.
Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of six genes <U+2013> MYO7A,
USH1C, CDH23, PCDH15, USH1G, and CIB2 <U+2013> establishes the diagnosis if clinical
features are inconclusive. Possible digenic inheritance has been reported in a
few families.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: In infants: an initial trial of hearing 
aids to stimulate residual hearing and accustom the infant to auditory
stimulation. Cochlear implantation should be considered as young as medically
feasible. Sign language and tactile signs (once visual loss occurs) for families 
who choose non-auditory communication. Specialized training from educators of the
hearing impaired. Vestibular compensation therapy for children with residual
balance function and sensory substitution therapy for individuals with complete
absence of vestibular function. Standard treatments for retinitis pigmentosa.
Surveillance: Annual audiometry and tympanometry in those with cochlear implant
or hearing aids to assure adequate auditory stimulation. Annual otoscopic exam
with tympanometry in children with profound loss to evaluate for chronic otitis
media. Annual ophthalmologic evaluation, fundus photography, visual acuity,
visual field testing, electroretinography, optical coherence tomography, and
fundus autofluorescence from age 20 years. Agents/circumstances to avoid:
Competition in sports requiring acute vision and/or good balance may be difficult
and possibly dangerous. Because of the high risk for disorientation when
submerged in water, swimming needs to be undertaken with caution. Progressive
loss of peripheral vision impairs the ability to safely drive a car. Evaluation
of relatives at risk: The hearing of at-risk sibs should be assessed as soon
after birth as possible to allow early diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss.
GENETIC COUNSELING: USH1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At
conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being
affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of
being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the USH1-causing pathogenic variants
have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk
relatives, prenatal diagnosis for a pregnancy at increased risk, and
preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Long-term hearing loss in postlingually deaf (PD) adults may lead to brain
structural changes that affect the outcomes of cochlear implantation. We studied 
94 PD patients who underwent cochlear implantation and 37 patients who were
MRI-scanned within 2<U+2009>weeks after the onset of sudden hearing loss and expected
with minimal brain structural changes in relation to deafness. Compared with
those with sudden hearing loss, we found lower gray matter (GM) probabilities in 
bilateral thalami, superior, middle, inferior temporal cortices as well as the
central cortical regions corresponding to the movement and sensation of the lips,
tongue, and larynx in the PD group. Among these brain areas, the GM in the middle
temporal cortex showed negative correlation with disease duration, whereas the
other areas displayed positive correlations. Left superior, middle temporal
cortical, and bilateral thalamic GMs were the most accurate predictors of
post-cochlear implantation word recognition scores (mean absolute error [MAE] =
10.1, r = .82), which was superior to clinical variables used (MAE: 12.1,
p<U+2009><<U+2009>.05). Using the combined brain morphological and clinical features, we
achieved the best prediction of the outcome (MAE: 8.51, r = .90). Our findings
suggest that the cross-modal plasticity allowing the superior temporal cortex and
thalamus to process other modal sensory inputs reverses the initially lower
volume when deafness becomes persistent. The middle temporal cortex processing
higher-level language comprehension shows persistent negative correlations with
disease duration, suggesting this area's association with degraded speech
comprehensions due to long-term deafness. Morphological features combined with
clinical variables might play a key role in predicting outcomes of cochlear
implantation.

Revisiting Image-Language Networks for Open-ended Phrase Detection.

Plummer BA, Shih K, Li Y, Xu K, Lazebnik S, Sclaroff S, Saenko K.

Most existing work that grounds natural language phrases in images starts with
the assumption that the phrase in question is relevant to the image. In this
paper we address a more realistic version of the natural language grounding task 
where we must both identify whether the phrase is relevant to an image
\textbf{and} localize the phrase. This can also be viewed as a generalization of 
object detection to an open-ended vocabulary, introducing elements of few- and
zero-shot detection. We propose an approach for this task that extends Faster
R-CNN to relate image regions and phrases. By carefully initializing the
classification layers of our network using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), 
we encourage a solution that is more discerning when reasoning between similar
phrases, resulting in over double the performance compared to a naive adaptation 
on three popular phrase grounding datasets, Flickr30K Entities, ReferIt Game, and
Visual Genome, with test-time phrase vocabulary sizes of 5K, 32K, and 159K,
respectively.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension confers a poor prognosis in moderate or severe aortic
stenosis (AS), however, antihypertensive therapy (AHT) is often not prescribed
due to the perceived deleterious effects of vasodilation and negative inotropes.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety outcomes of AHT in adults with
moderate or severe AS.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE
and grey literature were searched without language restrictions up to 9 September
2019.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Two independent
reviewers performed screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessments from 
a systematic search of observational studies and randomised controlled trials
comparing AHT with a placebo or no AHT in adults with moderate or severe AS for
any parameter of efficacy and safety outcomes. Conflicts were resolved by the
third reviewer. Meta-analysis with pooled effect sizes using random-effects
model, were estimated in R.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, Left Ventricular (LV) Mass Index, systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and LV ejection fraction RESULTS: From
3025 publications, 31 studies (26<U+2009>500 patients) were included in the qualitative 
synthesis and 24 studies in the meta-analysis. AHT was not associated with
mortality when all studies were pooled, but heterogeneity was substantial across 
studies. The effect size of AHT differed according to drug class.
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) were associated with
reduced risk of mortality (Pooled HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80, p=0.006), The
differences in changes of haemodynamic or echocardiographic parameters from
baseline with and without AHT did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: AHT appears safe, is well tolerated. RAASi were associated with
clinical benefit in patients with moderate or severe AS.

BACKGROUND: One of the major challenges in nursing and medical education is to
foster the critical thinking ability and autonomous learning ability for
students. But the effect of different teaching methods on these abilities of
nursing or medical students has not been conclusive, and few studies have
directly compared the differences in the effects of different teaching methods.
As a result, it is necessary for students to evaluate the impact of different
teaching methods on critical thinking ability and autonomous learning ability.
METHODS: A systematic search will be performed using Chinese National Knowledge

State-space models of evoked potentials to localize the seizure onset zone.

Smith RJ, Kamali G, Hays M, Coogan CG, Crone NE, Sarma SV, Kang JY.

Surgical removal of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epilepsy patients is a
potentially curative treatment, but the process heavily relies on accurate
localization of the SOZ via visual inspection. SPES (Single-pulse electrical
stimulation) is a method recently used to explore inter-areal connectivity in
vivo to probe functional brain networks such as language and motor networks, and 
to a much lesser degree, seizure networks. We hypothesized that a dynamical
quantification of the connectivity networks derived from the evoked responses
induced by SPES could also be used to localize the SOZ. To test our hypothesis,
we used an intracranial EEG (iEEG) data set in which five epilepsy patients
underwent extensive SPES evaluation. For each patient, and for each dataset that 
stimulated a different pair of electrodes, we constructed a state-space model
from the patient's data. Specifically, we simultaneously estimated model
parameters under an exogenous pulse input to a dynamical system whose state
vector consisted of the response iEEG signals. Then, the size of the reachable
state space, as quantified by the maximum singular value of the reachability
matrix, ¥òmax(R), was computed and denoted as the "largest" network response
possible when stimulating the given pair. Our results suggest high agreement
between ¥òmax(R) and clinically annotated SOZ for patients with localizable
SOZs.Clinical Relevance- Our study applies dynamical systems theory to identify
epileptogenic brain regions, creating a novel tool that clinicians may use in
surgical planning for medically-refractory epilepsy patients.
